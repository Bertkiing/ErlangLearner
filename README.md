学习Erlang的总结和点点滴滴

这个世界是并行的！！！

Erlang之父Joe Armstrong 曾经说过：Concurrency is easy!!!

    The world is parallel.
    Things in the world don't share data.
    Things communicate with message.
    Things fail.



This is why we should program in a concurrent programming language

And yet most often we program real-world applications in sequential programming languages. This is uncessarily difficult.

By programming in a language what was designed for programming concurrent applications (like Erlang) concurrent programming becomes a lot easier.

Erlang programs model how we think and interact
Erlang程序模拟了我们如何思考,如何交互.

    Why not choose Erlang?
